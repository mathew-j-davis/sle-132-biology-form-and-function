# Phylogeny

Phylogeny is the history of evolutionary development of a species of group of organisms.

## Phylogenetic Tree
![phylogenetic tree](./phylogenetic-tree.svg)

These relationships can be depicted as a *phylogenetic tree.* 
Phylogenetic trees of complex multicellular organisms typically depict ancestral relationships as a directed acyclic graph,
which corresponds well to species taxonomy.
As understanding of phylogeny and agreed taxonomy are refined over time they will not always be in exact agreement.

[Horizontal genetic transfer](horizontal-genetic-transfer.md) creates complex evolutionary relationships in which a species may be connected by more than one path. 

 "Sequence comparisons suggest recent horizontal transfer of many genes among diverse species including across the boundaries of phylogenetic 'domains'. Thus determining the phylogenetic history of a species can not be done conclusively by determining evolutionary trees for single genes." <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>
