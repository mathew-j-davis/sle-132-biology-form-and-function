# Phylogeny

Phylogeny is the history of evolutionary development of a species of group of organisms.

## Phylogenetic Tree

These relationships can be depicted as a *phylogenetic tree.* 
Phylogenetic trees of complex multicellular organisms typically depict ancestral relationships as a undirected acyclic graph,
which corresponds well to species taxonomy.
As understanding of phylogeny and agreed taxonomy are refined over time they will not always be in exact agreement.

Phylogenetic trees allow reasoning about genetic material:
- Inferring species identity from the relatedness of DNA to samples of known species.
- Correlating traits to genes through comparison of genotype and phenotype of related species.

Phylogenies are inferred from genotype and phenotype.

Inherited genotype and phenotype are *homologies*

Similarities from convergent evolution are *analogies*
[Horizontal genetic transfer](horizontal-genetic-transfer.md) creates complex evolutionary relationships in which a species may be connected by more than one path. 

 "Sequence comparisons suggest recent horizontal transfer of many genes among diverse species including across the boundaries of phylogenetic 'domains'. Thus determining the phylogenetic history of a species can not be done conclusively by determining evolutionary trees for single genes." <sup id="a1">[1](#ref-1)</sup>
