# Taxonomy

Is the discipline of describing, naming and classifying organisms.

The named taxonomic unit at any level is a *taxon (pl taxa)*

The taxon *Panthera* is a genus.

Taxonomy creates a conceptual structure we use to understand the living world.

(Domain)
Kingdom
Phyla
Class
Order
Family
Genus
Species

The specificity of a taxonomic level is variable.

## Sister Taxa

Sister taxa share an immediate common ancestor.

*Pan* and *Homo* share a hypothesised common ancestor of genus *Hominini*
