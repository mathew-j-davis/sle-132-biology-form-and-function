Monophyletic Group, single included common ancestor




The textbook also uses this language of most closely related, but unless you define what the length of the lines on the phylogenetic tree means, isn't really only telling you b and c have a more a more recent common ancestor than a and b, c could have undergone massive change, and now be more distantly related?
